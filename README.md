# July

### TODO: 
- Specify color range in heatmaps. 
  - A few outliers shift the entire range
- Add some sort of config file/dict/class to make plots more customisable.
- Add wrapper around calendar plot to simply plot calendar for a given month.
- Add flake8.
- Add Makefile.


### Why "July"?
The obvious names `calplot` and `calendarplot` were both already taken by similar packages.

The reasoning was roughly as follows:
- **Q**: What is this package doing?
- **A**: Create heatmaps of daily data, grouped by month and year.
- **Q**: Heat... month... year... Every year is the hottest year ever nowadays, but what is the hottest month?
- **A**: :sparkles: :sparkles: :sparkles: July :sparkles: :sparkles: :sparkles:  

Also, July is my favourite month by a light year.
