# July



## Why "July"?
The obvious names `calplot` and `calendarplot` were both already taken by similar packages.

The reasoning was roughly as follows:
- **Q**: What is this package doing?
- **A**: Create heatmaps of daily data, grouped by month and year.
- **Q**: Heat... month... year... Every year is the hottest year ever nowadays, but what is the hottest month?
- **A**: :sparkle: :sparkle: :sparkle: July :sparkle: :sparkle: :sparkle:  

Also, July is my favourite month. By a light year.
